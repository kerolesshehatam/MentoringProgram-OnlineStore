Installing a local instance of SonarQube (https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/get-started-2-minutes/)
-------------------------
From the Docker image use https://hub.docker.com/_/sonarqube/

Start the server by running:
 docker run -d --name sonarqube -e SONAR_ES_BOOTSTRAP_CHECKS_DISABLE=true -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:latest


 Analyzing a Project
Now that you're logged in to your local SonarQube instance, let's analyze a project:

Click the Create new project button.
Give your project a Project key and a Display name and click the Set Up button.
Under Provide a token, select Generate a token. Give your token a name, click the Generate button, and click Continue.
Select your project's main language under Run analysis on your project, and follow the instructions to analyze your project. Here you'll download and execute a Scanner on your code (if you're using Maven or Gradle, the Scanner is automatically downloaded).
After successfully analyzing your code, you'll see your first analysis on SonarQube:


setup the project steps:
-------------------
Scanner .NET Core Global Tool
As a prerequisite you need to have the sonarscanner tool installed globally using the following command:

1- dotnet tool install --global dotnet-sonarscanner
Make sure dotnet tools folder is in your path. See dotnet global tools documentation for more information.
Execute the Scanner
Running a SonarQube analysis is straighforward. You just need to execute the following commands at the root of your solution.

2- dotnet sonarscanner begin /k:"OnlineStore" /d:sonar.host.url="http://localhost:9000"  /d:sonar.login="sqp_49b94045144271fe608b33597a6afce5c9c638e1"
3- dotnet build
dotnet sonarscanner end /d:sonar.login="sqp_49b94045144271fe608b33597a6afce5c9c638e1"
